# System Types in Healthcare Systems Engineering

## Introduction
- Revisiting the complexity of healthcare systems and the need for systems engineering.

## Types of Systems
- **Complex Systems**: Single, integrated systems made of interrelated components.
- **System of Systems**: Multiple complex systems integrated for a greater capability.
- **Enterprise Systems**: System of systems plus human and process elements.

## Importance of Understanding Systems in Healthcare
- **Complexity in Healthcare**: 
  - The healthcare system is not just a complex system but can be seen as a "system of systems" and even an "enterprise system."
- **Roles in an Enterprise System**: 
  - In healthcare, doctors, administrators, and other professionals are involved, adding to the system's complexity.

## Why Systems Engineering?
- **Need for Better Integration**: Especially in high-stake environments like ICUs.
- **Improving Outcomes**: Better productivity, affordability, and accessibility can be achieved through integrated systems.
- Quote: "It's not just systems engineering, it's systems of systems engineering and enterprise systems engineering."

## Challenges in Healthcare Systems
- **Involvement of Multiple Elements**: Technology, people, and processes are involved.
- **Different System Challenges**: Varying from outpatient to inpatient.
- Quote: "Each one of these solutions will require technology, people, and processes, which normally will make it a system of system or enterprise system solution."

## Preparing for Next Module
- Reflective questions focused on understanding the attributes of different types of systems.
- Preparation for diving into systems engineering in healthcare.
- Prompt: "Think through the different types of system that you are aware of in healthcare, and then that'll help you as we move forward into systems engineering those healthcare systems."
