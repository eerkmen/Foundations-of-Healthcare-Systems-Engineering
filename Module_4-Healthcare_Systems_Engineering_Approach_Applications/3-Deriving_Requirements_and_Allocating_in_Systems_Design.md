# Deriving Requirements and Allocating in Systems Design

## Introduction to Stage 7: Developing Requirements
- **Key Takeaway:** Requirements are essential for solving the problem, not just something we want or think about.

## The Process of Developing Requirements
1. **Needs and Requirements:** Identify the needs, requirements, and gaps.
2. **Functions, Concepts, and Architectures:** These components are crucial in developing requirements.
   - **Note:** The sequence can vary depending on the example.
3. **Operational Requirements:** "How well, how accurate, how timely?"
4. **Example:** Providing treatment to cancer patients.

## Functions and Allocation
- **Simple Functions:**
  1. Monitor
  2. Enter
  3. Transfer
  4. Prescribe
- **Allocating Accuracy:** Each function must meet a predetermined level of accuracy.
- **Time Allocation:** The sum of the time spent on all functions should meet the operational requirement (e.g., 48 hours).

## Traceability and Defense
- **Traceability:** The chosen solution should be able to trace back to addressing the gap.
- **Defense:** Justify why specific solutions were chosen based on the requirements approach.
