# Deriving Requirements and Allocating in Systems Design

## Introduction to Stage 7: Developing Requirements
- **Key Takeaway:** Requirements are essential for solving the problem, not just something we want or think about.

## The Process of Developing Requirements
1. **Needs and Requirements:** Identify the needs, requirements, and gaps.
2. **Functions, Concepts, and Architectures:** These components are crucial in developing requirements.
   - **Note:** The sequence can vary depending on the example.
3. **Operational Requirements:** "How well, how accurate, how timely?"
4. **Example:** Providing treatment to cancer patients.

## Functions and Allocation
- **Simple Functions:**
  1. Monitor
  2. Enter
  3. Transfer
  4. Prescribe
- **Allocating Accuracy:** Each function must meet a predetermined level of accuracy.
- **Time Allocation:** The sum of the time spent on all functions should meet the operational requirement (e.g., 48 hours).

## Traceability and Defense
- **Traceability:** The chosen solution should be able to trace back to addressing the gap.
- **Defense:** Justify why specific solutions were chosen based on the requirements approach.

## Stage 8: Systems Design
- **Design is Driven by Requirements:** "You can't have a design absent of requirements."
- **Design Considerations:** The design should satisfy operational needs, meet timelines, and fulfill predetermined accuracy levels.

## Common Pitfalls and Issues
1. **Poor Requirements:** Must be clear and traceable.
2. **Environment:** Know where the healthcare solution will be implemented.
3. **End-User:** "We cannot forget the end-user."
4. **Measures and Metrics:** Should be specific and properly assessed.

## Additional Design Tips
- **Visibility:** The system should be visible to all stakeholders.
- **Complexity:** Don't overcomplicate the design.
- **Risk:** Avoid unnecessary risks.
- **Honesty and Balance:** Keep designers honest and solutions balanced between software and hardware.
- **Monitoring and Reviews:** Continuously monitor progress and hold reviews.

## Conclusion
- **Always ensure that requirements are met and traceable.**
- **Pay attention to all aspects including the end-user, the environment, and the measures and metrics.**
- **Maintain a balanced and clear design to satisfy all stakeholders.**
