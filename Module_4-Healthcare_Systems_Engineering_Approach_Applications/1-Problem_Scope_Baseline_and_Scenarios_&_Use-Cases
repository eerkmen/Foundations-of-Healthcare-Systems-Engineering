## Introduction
- Course: Johns Hopkins University, Whiting School of Engineering
- Topic: Consolidation of previous modules to focus on healthcare systems engineering applications.

## Recap of Previous Modules
1. **Healthcare Drivers**: Discussed the healthcare context including healthcare systems and services.
2. **System Types**: Covered complex systems, systems of systems, and enterprise systems.
3. **Systems Engineering Approach**: Detailed a 13-stage systems engineering approach.

## Objective of Module 4
- Bring all learned items together to show applications in healthcare.

## Understanding Objectives and Context
- Importance: Must understand objectives and context of your problem within healthcare.

## Types of Systems
- **Complex System**: Example - Ventilator
- **Systems of Systems**: Example - ICU
- **Enterprise Systems**: Example - ICU within a hospital
- **Understanding Scope**: Decide whether you're focusing on a single piece of equipment, an ICU, or an entire hospital system.

## Defining the Problem Scope
- **Questions to Consider**:
    - "Is my responsibility just for the ventilator?"
    - "Is my problem scope the whole ICU?"
    - "Is my scope and responsibility for the hospital within the ICU?"
- **Levels of Scope**: Suite level, Station level, Floor level, Entire hospital level
