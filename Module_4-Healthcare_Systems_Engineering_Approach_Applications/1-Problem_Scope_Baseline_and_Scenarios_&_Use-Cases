## Introduction
- Course: Johns Hopkins University, Whiting School of Engineering
- Topic: Consolidation of previous modules to focus on healthcare systems engineering applications.

## Recap of Previous Modules
1. **Healthcare Drivers**: Discussed the healthcare context including healthcare systems and services.
2. **System Types**: Covered complex systems, systems of systems, and enterprise systems.
3. **Systems Engineering Approach**: Detailed a 13-stage systems engineering approach.

## Objective of Module 4
- Bring all learned items together to show applications in healthcare.

## Understanding Objectives and Context
- Importance: Must understand objectives and context of your problem within healthcare.

## Types of Systems
- **Complex System**: Example - Ventilator
- **Systems of Systems**: Example - ICU
- **Enterprise Systems**: Example - ICU within a hospital
- **Understanding Scope**: Decide whether you're focusing on a single piece of equipment, an ICU, or an entire hospital system.

## Defining the Problem Scope
- **Questions to Consider**:
    - "Is my responsibility just for the ventilator?"
    - "Is my problem scope the whole ICU?"
    - "Is my scope and responsibility for the hospital within the ICU?"
- **Levels of Scope**: Suite level, Station level, Floor level, Entire hospital level

## Baseline and Needs
- **Baseline**: Current state of the system. What is the existing system that you have?
- **Gap Identification**: Find gaps to develop requirements, design, and implementation strategies.
- **Lifecycle**: Production, deployment, and in-service to set the stage for the new baseline.

## Tools for Establishing Baseline
- **Scenarios and Use-Cases**: Operational stories that describe events.
    - **Types of Areas**: Cardiac, trauma, medical, surgical, neurological, pediatric, neonatal.
    - **Narrative Example**: "A 92-year-old female needs pacemaker-lead surgery and has to be in the ICU for a certain amount of time."

## Key Takeaways
- **Problem scope is crucial**: Understanding it helps in allocating resources effectively.
- **Baseline is the starting point**: It helps identify gaps and plan for improvements.
- **Scenarios and Use-Cases provide context**: They help in understanding the operational needs and conditions.
