### Page 4: Concept Exploration in Systems Engineering
- **Concept Exploration:** Crucial in understanding the problem scope and challenges.
    - **Objective:** Inspire new concepts through brainstorming or design thinking exercises.
  
#### Steps in Concept Exploration:
1. **Design Challenge:** Define what the problem statement and inspiration are.
2. **Ideation:** Generate ideas to address the need and the problem.
3. **Implementation:** Discuss possible solutions and how to achieve them.

### ICU Example: Addressing Harms
- Explore the different types of harms in an ICU setting.
    - **Goal:** Create problem statements for each type of harm and brainstorm possible solutions.
- **Concept of Operations:**
    - Consolidate solutions to visualize a new type of ICU.
    - Includes different types of clinical displays, reminders, and family-friendly portals.

### Introduction to Architectures
- **Importance of Architectures** in the systems engineering process.
- **Stakeholder Perspectives:** Multiple viewpoints can be both an asset and a challenge.
    - "Pretend the elephant is the problem."

### Zachman Architecture Framework
- **Different views of the problem:**
    - Functional perspective
    - Technological build
    - Enterprise or systems level
    - Scope

#### Questions to Address:
- What is it?
- How is it put together?
- Where, Who, When, Why?

### Examples of Architectures in Healthcare
- **Different levels of abstraction:**
    1. Simple View: Focuses on large blocks of information and stakeholders.
    2. Abstract View: Shows specific areas and types of communications.
    3. Implementation-Adjacent: Drills down into databases, web services, and client information.
