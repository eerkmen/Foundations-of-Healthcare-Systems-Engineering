# Systems of Systems

## Introduction
- Overview of Complex Systems as a foundational concept.
- Introduction of two additional types of systems: System of Systems and another unspecified type.
- Importance of differentiating between these types for both developers and end-users.

## System of Systems: Definition
- **System of Systems**: "An arrangement of complex systems that are put together to give a certain capability."
- **Key Aspect**: Loss of any complex system can degrade the performance of the whole.
    - **Example**: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has multiple complex systems (ventilators, echocardiograms, x-ray systems) that operate together to improve patient care.

## Attributes of a System of Systems
1. **Operational Independence**:
    - Each complex system within can operate independently in other contexts.
2. **Managerial Independence**:
    - Systems are brought into the 'System of Systems' by a management structure.
3. **Geographic Distribution**:
    - Systems can be spread out over distances, not necessarily miles but could be feet and yards.
4. **Emergent Behavior**:
    - Unpredictable characteristics and outcomes that arise when multiple complex systems work together.
5. **Evolutionary Development**:
    - The system can evolve by improving or integrating the constituent complex systems.

## Types of Systems of Systems
1. **Directed Systems of Systems**:
    - One authority orchestrates the complex systems.
2. **Acknowledged Systems of Systems**:
    - No single authority but guided by overarching documents or requirements.
3. **Collaborative Systems of Systems**:
    - Evolved organically over time with no guiding document.
4. **Virtual Systems of Systems**:
    - No central management, people work together in a virtual context for a common capability.

## Concluding Thoughts
- The choice of system type depends on roles and objectives.
- Systems of Systems can evolve from one type to another, e.g., from Collaborative to Acknowledged to Directed.
