# Types of Systems

This section delves into various types of systems pertinent to healthcare systems engineering. Understanding the uniqueness and the interplay of these systems is vital for approaching challenges in healthcare with a systematic lens.

## Complex Systems
Definition, attributes, and challenges associated with Complex Systems.

## Systems of Systems
Definition, attributes, types, and key considerations of Systems of Systems.

## Enterprise Systems
Introduction, definition, attributes, and challenges of Enterprise Systems in healthcare.

Understanding the attributes and challenges of these systems lays the groundwork for applying systems engineering principles in healthcare, which will be further explored in subsequent modules.
