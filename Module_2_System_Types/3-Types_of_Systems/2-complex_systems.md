# Complex Systems

Complex Systems are defined as a set of interrelated components working together towards a common objective. A good example to illustrate a complex system is a ventilator system, which comprises motors, screens, tubing, and other components working together to aid in respiratory support.

## Definition
- **Complex System**: "A set of interrelated components working together towards some common objective."
  - **Example**: A ventilator system has motors, screens, tubing, and other components that work together to help people breathe.

## Attributes of a Complex System
- **Single Integrated System**: It's not multiple systems but one system like a single ventilator.
- **Single Acquisition Authority**: Usually, there is one sponsor or vendor responsible for procurement.
- **Scope for Problem-Solving**: Geared to solve a specific set of problems, e.g., ventilators in an ICU or a home setup.

## Challenges in Complex Systems
1. **Limited Scope**: A single system cannot address all existing needs. Systems are usually designed for specific purposes.
2. **Balanced Design**: It's challenging to meet all requirements simultaneously.
3. **Risks**: Risks can be budgetary, technical, schedule-based, or even pose risks to end users.
4. **Resource Competition**: Possible competition for resources within the organization for building the system.
