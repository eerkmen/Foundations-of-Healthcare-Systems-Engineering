# Enterprise Systems

### Introduction
The lecture focuses on Enterprise Systems as a type of system in healthcare, extending from Complex Systems and Systems of Systems.

### Types of Systems
1. **Complex Systems**: Technical hardware and software systems.
2. **Systems of Systems**: Multiple complex systems working together.
3. **Enterprise Systems**: Combination of people, decision points, workflows, and technical systems.

### Defining Enterprise System
- **Enterprise System**: Includes a combination of people, decision points, and workflow processes, alongside the attributes of a system of systems.
    - **Mission**: Achieving common goals and objectives.
    - **Components**: Complex systems, multiple networks, and organizations.
"As we go to enterprise system, we go beyond technical systems to include people and processes."

### Attributes of Enterprise System
- Similar to a System of Systems, but with added elements.
    - **Technology**: Existing in previous systems.
    - **People and Processes**: New elements added.
    - **Geographic Distribution**: Seen in both types.
    - **External Resourcing**: Need for resources external to the organization.

### Challenges in Enterprise Systems
- **Scope and Scale**: Increases greatly compared to other system types.
- **Unpredictable Elements**: People and processes add complexity.
- **Multiple Stakeholders**: Administrators, clinicians, engineers, etc.
- **Evolving Needs**: Adaptability to changes in policy and healthcare views.
"There is a fine balance between providing guidelines and achieving goals and objectives."

### Tailoring Systems Engineering
- As systems become complex, there's a need to adapt system engineering principles accordingly.
    - **Complex Systems**: Single acquisition with interrelated components.
    - **System of Systems**: Multiple complex systems with operational and managerial independence.
    - **Enterprise Systems**: Adds people and processes to a system of systems.
"As you go to the right, you have to adapt systems engineering principles to account for the different types of complications."
