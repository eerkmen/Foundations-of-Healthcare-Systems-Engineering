# Requirements and Systems Design

## Types of Requirements

- **Operational Requirements:** Early in the process, focused on operations.
- **Functional Requirements:** Tied to functions in the system.
- **Performance Requirements:** Defines how well a task should be performed.
- **Physical/Core Requirements:** Concerns physical attributes like size.
- **Interface Requirements:** Specifies how different parts will connect.
- **Data Requirements:** Data type, data stream, etc.

    > Note: "It's important to know where you're at in terms of what you're developing for requirements."

## Systems Engineering Process Flow

- Gaps, needs, operations, functions, concepts all feed into requirements.
- Non-linear Process: You may have to modify things over time.

    > Important: Requirements must be traceable both down the flow and back up.

### The Use of 'Shall' in Requirements

- Use the term "shall" to define a requirement.

    > Tip: "Having a version of a shall statement helps people keep track of the requirements much easier."

## Transition to Systems Design

- Quantitative requirements originate from needs and flow into functions, concepts, and architectures.

    > Note: "Absent of requirements, we're just basically building blind."

## Systems Design: Critical Elements

1. **Traceability and Allocation:** Requirements must be traceable and allocated, or else "you're just building something that nobody needs."
2. **Trade-Studies:** To figure out the best solution or options.
3. **Prototyping:** Creating mockups for testing.
4. **Iterative Design:** Continuous testing and improvement.

## System Considerations

- May involve personnel, functions, clinicians, administrators, patients, and their families.

## Practical Examples

- Building a deck
- Designing a mother-in-law suite
- Healthcare examples: Designing a ventilator system, developing an ICU, or building a hospital.

    > Task: "Come up with those requirements, and look at how you allocate those requirements to your final system design."
