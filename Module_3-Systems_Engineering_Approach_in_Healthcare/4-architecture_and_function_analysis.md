# Architecture and Function Analysis

## Why Do We Need Architectures?
- **Conceptual Model:** In systems engineering, an architecture serves as a conceptual model of the system being developed.
- **Stakeholder Perspectives:** Various stakeholders view a system from different angles. An architecture helps baseline these viewpoints.
- **Teamwork:** Helps the team to work systematically by defining the structure.

## Importance of Conceptual Models
- Enable more systematic team collaboration.
- Define structure and interactions.
- Facilitate logical decision-making.

> _"If you can have conceptual models where you can baseline people and how to view the system, you will be able to more systematically work together as a team."_

## Functional Analysis and Allocation
- **Defining Function:** Before thinking of the physical aspects, it's crucial to define the functions of a system.
- **Baseline Requirements:** Defining functions helps to establish what the system needs to do.

## Verb-Noun Construct
- Functions come in the form of a verb-noun construct, e.g., monitor a patient or enter data.
- This construct doesn't specify how to do it but establishes the need to do it.

> _"I'm not telling you physically how to do it. That will come later. But if we don't have a baseline function, we won't really know what physical elements are the best fit."_

## Tradespace and Metrics
- Functions can be quantified by metrics like accuracy and speed.
- This quantification helps in determining the physical systems that might be the best fit.

## Avoid Jumping to Physical Solutions
- Limitation: Jumping to physical solutions limits creativity and options.

> _"When you jump to have immediate physical solution, you limit the ideas that you bring forward."_
