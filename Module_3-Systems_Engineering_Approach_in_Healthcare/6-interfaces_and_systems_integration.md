# Interfaces and Systems Integration

## Definition of Interfaces
- **Key Point:** The definition of interfaces is an essential stage in the systems engineering process.
- **Context:** During system design, interfaces are often overlooked because everyone is focused on their specific role.
- **Importance:** A healthcare systems engineer needs to recognize these interfaces to avoid flaws and risks.
  - "Interfaces are one of those items that get lost in the system design because nobody takes responsibility for it."

### Types of Interfaces
- **Software-Hardware Interfaces:** For two entities within a system that need to communicate.
- **Context Diagrams:** High-level representation to understand inputs, outputs, governance, and infrastructure.
- **Human-Machine Interface:** Interaction between humans and computers (e.g., a video game).
- **Electro-Mechanical Interfaces:** Wiring and electronics within a system.
- **Virtual Interfaces:** Virtual reality elements.
- **Human-to-Human Interfaces:** Interactions among clinicians, patients, and administrators in healthcare.
  - "Think about human machine interfaces. A video game, for example, or just something you're working on your PC. There's some human machine interface, you're looking at the machine, you're touching the machine, that is an interface."

### Importance of Interfaces in Healthcare
- **Timeliness:** Quick and efficient communication is crucial.
- **Accuracy:** Information must be precise.
- **Completeness:** All necessary elements should be included.
  - "If any of these are impacted from a healthcare perspective, bad things can happen."
