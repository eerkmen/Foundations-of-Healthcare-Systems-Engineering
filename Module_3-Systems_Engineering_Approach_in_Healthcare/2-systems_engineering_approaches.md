# Systems Engineering Approaches

## Types of Systems Engineering Approaches

- Different framing, cycles, and rubrics are used in various systems engineering approaches.
- **Three Core Steps** involved in these approaches:
  1. **Define the problem:** Understand the issue at hand that needs resolution.
  2. **Methods to solve the problem:** Implement strategies to address the defined problem.
  3. **Verification of problem resolution:** Ensure that the problem has been adequately resolved.

- Various approaches include **spiral**, **linear**, **V-model**, or **Agile** methodologies depending on the specific needs and context of the project.

## Framework for Systems Engineering Approach

- **Understanding the Context:** 
  - Objectives and problem definition are crucial to comprehend the environment in which the system will operate.
- **System Types:** 
  - It's important to know the type of system at hand whether it's a complex system, a system of systems, or an enterprise system.
- **Current Systems & Goals:** 
  - Understand the starting point and what the intended outcomes are.
- **Gaps and Needs:** 
  - Align system context and scope to address any discrepancies and fulfill requirements.
- **Concept Exploration:** 
  - Explore various architectures to solve the problem.
- **Functional Analysis & Allocation:** 
  - Ensure the problem is well-defined and allocate functions accordingly.
- **Requirements:** 
  - Establish quantitative measures for performance to guide the engineering process.
- **Design & Interfaces:** 
  - Understand the interconnection of different elements within the system.
- **Integration, Testing, and Deployment:** 
  - These are the final stages of the engineering process where the system is completed, tested for functionality, and deployed for use.

This section encapsulates the different methodologies and frameworks that can be applied in a Systems Engineering context, providing a foundation for tackling engineering projects in a structured and organized manner.
