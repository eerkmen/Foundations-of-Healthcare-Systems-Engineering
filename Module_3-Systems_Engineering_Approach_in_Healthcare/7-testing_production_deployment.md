# Testing, Production, and Deployment

## Testing and Evaluation (Stage 11)
- **Overview:** 
  - Testing and evaluation occur throughout the system's life cycle, with an emphasis on their crucial role at the end of the process.
  - **Two-Stage Process:**
    - **Testing:** The system is placed in an infrastructure to collect data.
    - **Evaluation:** The collected data is analyzed and compared against requirements and specifications.
  - **Goal:** Ensure that the system and its components meet the requirements.

- **Lifecycle Emphasis:**
  - Occurs during requirements and function development through test events.
  - More classical testing infrastructure is seen when functions transition to design.
  - Detailed component-level testing occurs in later stages.
  - Integration tests occur when elements are brought together.
  - Final tests take place at the operational level involving administrators, clinicians, etc.
  
## Production and Deployment (Stage 12)
- **Overview:**
  - After designing, integrating, and building, the next steps are production and deployment.

- **Two Terms Explained:**
  - **Production:** Reproducing the designed and tested item.
  - **Deployment:** Installing the produced items in an operational setting like an ICU or hospital.

- **Logistics and Monitoring:**
  - Continuous monitoring is required to ensure correct deployment.

- **Knowledge Base and Organization:**
  - Production and deployment often require different knowledge and experience bases than design.
  - Efficient organization is key for transition from design to production and deployment.

- **Infrastructure and Regulations:**
  - Be aware of the environment and how the system will be housed.
  - Adhere to existing standards and regulations to avoid pitfalls.
