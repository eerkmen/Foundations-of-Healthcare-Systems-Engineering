# Stage-by-Stage Overview

## Baseline and Needs
- **Scope of Problem:** Define the boundaries clearly to prevent doing too little or too much.
- **Timeline:** Understand the urgency and time constraints.
- **Context of Problem:** Consider geographical and situational contexts.
- **Stakeholders:** Identify all parties involved (administrators, clinicians, family, patients).
- **Problem Framing:** Determine factors based on scope, timeline, and context.

## Stage 3: Understanding Needs and Requirements

### Defining Needs
- **Need:** "A gap between current function and desired function."
  - **Purpose:** To create a general description of what is needed.
  - **Format:** Narrative; no quantitative measures yet.
  - **Key Points:**
    - Not deriving a solution at this stage.
    - "A need is not a want."

### Transition to Requirements
- **Requirement:** Quantitative expression of needs.
  - **Example:** "I need to get medication to a patient within three hours."
  - **Key Points:**
    - Derived directly from needs.
    - "Not an engineering metric" because it describes what needs to be done but not how.
    - "It's not a want, what do you actually need to solve the problem?"

## Stage 4: Concept Exploration

### Introduction
- Concepts address the requirements from the previous stage.
  - **Example:**
    - **Operational Need:** "Timely access to a ventilator system in an ICU."
    - **Quantitative Measure:** "Access to the ventilator PEEP settings within three seconds."

### Exploring Concepts
- Use modeling and mock-ups to explore concepts.
  - Could involve physical layouts or human-machine interfaces.

## Architectures: Bringing Structure to Concepts
- **Purpose:** To define structure and behavior of the system.
  - **Key Points:**
    - Develops "conceptual models."
    - Allows for understanding interactions and interconnections within the system.
  - **Summary:**
    - "Without structure, it's hard to understand how all the elements interact."
