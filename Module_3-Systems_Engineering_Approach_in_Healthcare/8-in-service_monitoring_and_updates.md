# In-Service Monitoring and Updates: Stage 13 of Systems Engineering

## Overview:
- Final stage in the Systems Engineering process.
- Comes after operational lead, production, and deployment stages.
- The system or enterprise system is now operational.

## Key Objectives of In-Service Monitoring and Updates

1. **Manage the Deployed System:**
    - Understand technical, logistical, and sometimes healthcare-specific needs.
2. **Change Management:**
    - Systems are not perfect when deployed.
    - "How do you change the system?"
    - Importance of proper configuration control.
3. **Service Delivery:**
    - How the deployed system fits into existing workflows like ICU, hospital, etc.
4. **Supply Chain Optimization:**
    - Systems eventually break down.
    - How to ensure proper logistics for maintenance?
5. **Data Collection and Improvement:**
    - "If we donâ€™t track what's going on, we won't be able to collect the data that we need in order to determine how we actually improve things over time."
